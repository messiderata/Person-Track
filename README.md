# Person-Track
This project involves creating an intelligent system for real-time person detection and tracking using a camera, computer, and Arduino Nano. YOLOv8 identifies the person's position within the camera's view. The system calculates the angle and sends it to the Arduino via PySerial, which adjusts a servo motor to keep the person centered in the frame.
